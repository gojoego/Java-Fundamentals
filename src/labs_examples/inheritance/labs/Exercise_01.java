/**
 * Inheritance Exercise 1:
 *
 *      1) Create one super class Class1 and two subclasses Class2 and Class3.
 *
 *          -Class2 should extend Class1.
 *          -Class3 should extend Class2.
 *
 *          Class1 = Politician
 *          String party;
 *          int yearsActive;
 *          String currentOffice;
 *
 *          Class2 = Senator
 *          String state;
 *          int yearsOffice;
 *
 *
 *          Class3 = Warren
 *          String careerBeforeLaw;
 *          String lawPractice;
 *
 *      2) Each class should have at least two instance variable, all private.
 *         -completed
 *      3) Create getters and setters for all instance variables and demonstrate setting superclass
 *          variables from a subclass
 *          -completed
 *      4) Demonstrate the use of (non getter and setter) methods in a superclass from a subclass.
 *
 *          -created warren object and used that to call methods for warren object from Warren class
 *
 *      5) Add constructors to each class and demonstrate the use of a superclass constructor
 *          from a subclass.
 *
 *          -created warren object and used constructors originally in Politician class to create object
 *
 *      6) Demonstrate constructor overloading and the use of the "super" keyword.
 *
 *          -demonstrated in Warren class to create constructor from constructors in parent classes
 *
 *      7) Demonstrate method overloading.
 *
 *          -demonstrated in Politician with averageAge() methods 
 *
 *      NOTE: We encourage you to be creative and try to think of an example of your own for this
 *       exercise but if you are stuck, some ideas include:
 *
 *       - A Vehicle superclass, with Truck and Motorcycle subclasses.
 *       - A Restaurant superclass, with Gourmet and FastFood subclasses.
