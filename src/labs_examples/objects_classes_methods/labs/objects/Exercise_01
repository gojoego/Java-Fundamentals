Following the example in CarExample.java, please use Object Composition to model an Airplane class.
The Airplane class must be composed of at least 4 other classes (as well as any primitive types you'd like).
The Airplane class itself should have a fuel capacity (double) variable, as well as a currentFuelLevel variable.
We'll use these a bit later.

object composition
- restricted form of association
- two entities highly dependent on each other
- "part of"
- two entities cannot exist without the other
