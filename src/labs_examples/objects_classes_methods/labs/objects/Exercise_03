For this exercise please create two classes. The first class is the controller and it will contain the main() method.
The second class is a POJO. Just a simple object type class that defines an object. In this POJO, demonstrate
at least three overloaded constructors. In the main() method, create at least 3 objects of your POJO class, each using
a different constructor.

constructor:
-special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called just after the memory is allocated for the object

overload constructors: define multiple constructors which differ in number and/or types of parameters
