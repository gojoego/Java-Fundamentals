/**
 * Lambdas Exercise 1:
 *
 *      1)  Demonstrate creating a functional interface with an abstract method
 *          that takes no parameters and returns void
 *
 *          see FunctionalSum interface
 *
 *      2)  Implement the previous functional interface with a lambda expression
 *          and use it. Also demonstrate creating
 *          an anonymous inner class from this interface.
 *
 *          see AnonInnerClassFuncSum
 *          see LambdaFunctionalSum
 *          see LambdaController
 *
 *      3)  Demonstrate creating a functional interface with an abstract method
 *          that takes 1 parameter and returns a value of the same type as the parameter
 *
 *          see FunctionalReturn
 *
 *      4)  Implement the previous functional interface with a lambda expression and
 *          use it. Also demonstrate creating an anonymous inner class from this interface.
 *
 *          see AnonInnerClassFuncRet
 *          see LambdaController
 *
 *      5)  Demonstrate creating a functional interface with an abstract method that
 *          takes 2 parameters and returns a value
 *
 *          see FunctionalDivide
 *
 *      6)  Implement the previous functional interface with a
 *          lambda expression and use it. Also demonstrate creating
 *          an anonymous inner class from this interface.
 *
 *          see AnonInnerClassFuncDiv
 *          see LambdaController
 *
 *      7)  Demonstrate the use of at least two built-in functional interfaces
 *          from the java.util.function package.
