The town of Ubud, in the uplands of Bali, Indonesia,
is known as a center for traditional crafts and dance.
The surrounding Ubud District’s rainforest and terraced
rice paddies, dotted with Hindu temples and shrines,
are among Bali’s most famous landscapes. Ancient holy
sites include the intricately carved Goa Gajah
(“Elephant Cave”) and Gunung Kawi, with its rock-cut shrines.
